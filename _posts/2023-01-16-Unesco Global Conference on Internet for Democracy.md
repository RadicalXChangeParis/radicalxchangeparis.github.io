title:  "Unesco Global conference on internet for Trust - Paris Feb 21-23"
---

On February 21-23, 2023, UNESCO will hold a 3-day conference on the topic of Internet for Trust in its Parisian headquarters. The [event](https://www.unesco.org/en/internet-conference) is co-organized by [#RadicalXChange](https://www.radicalxchange.org/) France, [#leplusimportant](https://leplusimportant.org/) and the [#TESaCo programme](https://www.tesaco.fr/).

RadicalXChange France will conduct [#speculative design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_design) interviews of participants in relationship with three topics:
- How to organize the access to platform data for regulatory claims or open research purposes?
- How could digital platform governance interact with users in a manageable way?
- What kind of safeguards will be needed to filter facts and fakes 10 years from now?

These topics challenge our interviewees about new issues to come 10 years from now or about new emerging stakeholders.

The summary of the collected interviews will be shared as an introduction to the last roundtable of the day : _UNESCO guidance for regulating digital platforms: how to secure effective implementation?_

The interview material will also be shared publicly here.

The event is open to the public, please come and meet us. [#Don't forget to register](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPageV2.aspx?subpage=design&FormId=0ueuCdngDkei64yDImh2xxSFMNALCOVFg4-Z2Isvp6NUNlFYUkhKV0o1QVZGQVdGUFJIN0gxSEFLMi4u&Token=81ef9158a7dc41d9bc45cd290157323c).
